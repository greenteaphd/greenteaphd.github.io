I created a blog. I am going to write about tech, product, and my life in general. <br>

I really want to take this blog seriously and keep it going. I think I will do a better job since I am not doing it for school.  <br>

I am both worried that no one will read my blog and also worried that people will read my blog.  <br>

What do you call this? I am sure there is a word for it. <br>

I do value my privacy, but I think there is a way to share content without compromising my personal life. <br>

Cheers.   <br>
