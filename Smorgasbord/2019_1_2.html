Wait, why didn't Andy post an entry on New Year's Day? Was he too tired from partying the day before? <br> <br>

Nope - I just didn't have anything to post. <br> <br>

-------------------------------------------------------------- <br>

Today's entry is an idea for a short film about a college kid passing his computational biology course. <br> <br>

Guess who just passed his computational biology course? <br> <br>

-------> Andy Han <------- This kid right here <br> <br> <br>

I am feeling FANTASTIC. I really thought I was going to get a C-. Yikes! <br>

Also, GPA isn't that important. Anything above a 3 is solid. Anything above a 3.5 is marginally useful. The usual suspects are: <br>

<ol>
    <li>pre-med</li>
    <li>I-Banking and Consulting</li>
    <li>Grad School</li>
    <li>Students who still have good study habits from HS </li>
    <li>Low key brilliant international students</li>
</ol>

<br>

Life is good, man! Take that, computational biology.
