2018 is almost over! I am typing this at 8:29 pm. <br>

This is a beat I made that can serve as background music for a vocal part. <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------- <br>

I tried adding additional tracks, but I settled with just the drum loop and chords. It sounded better this way. <br>
Please reach out if you are interested in using the music. Thank you! <br> <br>
