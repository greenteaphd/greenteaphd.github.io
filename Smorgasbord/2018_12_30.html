This is a beat I made that can serve as background music. <br>
-------------------------------------------------------------- <br>

I am envisioning an intrusion scene. Or, when the main characters are in gears to do something dramatic or serious. <br>
I recommend turning the volume down if you end up using it. <br>
Please reach out if you are interested in using the music. Thank you! <br> <br>
